```

Authentication
--------------

See the [Authentication](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java#authentication) section in the base directory's README.

About Google Cloud Speech
----------------------------

Google [Cloud Speech API][cloud-speech-docs] enables easy integration of Google speech recognition technologies into developer applications. Send audio and receive a text transcription from the Cloud Speech API service.

See the ``google-cloud`` API [speech documentation][speech-api] to learn how to use this Cloud Speech API Client Library.

Getting Started
---------------
#### Prerequisites
You will need a [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) project with the Speech API enabled. [Follow these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#preparation) to get your project set up. You will also need to set up the local development environment by [installing the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) and running the following commands in command line: `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project [YOUR PROJECT ID]`.

#### Installation and setup
You'll need to obtain the `google-cloud-speech` library.  See the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section to add `google-cloud-speech` as a dependency in your code.

#### Complete source code

In [RecognizeSpeech.java](../google-cloud-examples/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/examples/speech/snippets/RecognizeSpeech.java) we put a quick start example, which shows how you can use Goolge Speech API to automatically recognize speech. This sample will transcript houman speech from an audio file to a text form.  

For an example audio file please check the [audio.raw](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples/blob/master/speech/cloud-client/resources/audio.raw) from the samples repository.
Note, to play the file on Unix-like system you may use the following command: `play -t raw -r 16k -e signed -b 16 -c 1 audio.raw`
